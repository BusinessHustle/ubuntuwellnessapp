# Ubuntuwellness Health App

The Ubuntu Health App is a prototype application built using the LAMP stack. accesssible here (**Link**)

The purpose of this application is to connect users to a database of plant-based resources in order to help educate them more on the plant based living lifestyle.

Get connected to a list of well curated vegan resources, lose weight, lower blood pressure and get people to reconnect to the healing energy source of nature in order to help you achieve your true highest self.

This project seeks to become a cornerstone of public health, and shape policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare through the mHealth App

Below is a curated list of ML algorithms, datasets and research papers we went through during the process of development.
